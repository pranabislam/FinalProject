    /* okay so messing with the image array in the other file is probably not smart because its very hard for us
    to test anything, we can't print lines bcz of the gui in the main method.
    so we do the testing separately and put a main method and tostring() in here i guess so we can test/print
        i thought that we should do the files to img file array transfer multiple times and note the order of the array
        if the order of the array holds constant with the order of the images 0-15, then we can individually name each image
        0-15 (hopefully). from there you can begin to attempt the correct tile function because now java can easily refer to 
        the image. the hard part is being able to name all the images from the array and do it knowing we got the right images 
        in the right order. */
