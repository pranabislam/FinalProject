We both worked on and finished and Pranab pushed the basic image splitter. Works perfectly, no errors

1/8/15 Adding image to panel gives error. Both of us are working on the same file. 

1/9/15 Remi and Pranab both fixed image adding to panel error. 

1/13/15 For the last few days we've been trying to figure out how to utilize mouse actions and dragging images. We have fixed minor bugs up until this point.
